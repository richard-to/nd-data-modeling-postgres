These Jupyter notebooks were filled out using the Udacity project workspace.

I've included them for reference, but in order to run them locally, they'll need to be
modified to work with this repository.

Changes needed:

- Update database connection strings
- Update local imports (i.e. sql_queries import)
- Update data file paths
